# Panel
- Collin: Mechanical Engnineering and CS @ UCSD
- Tristan: Computer Science @ Miramar, Currently has a job @ LG
- Mabel: CS @ UCSD
- Anthony: Computer Science/Quantative Economics @ UCI
    - Worked at CodeNinjas
    - Summer Internship at Viasat

# Insights
1. Prioritize AP CS courses like CSP and CSA for a solid start in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, Information Science, or Computer Engineering majors.
2. Given the competitive nature of computer science admissions, it's advisable to cast a wide net when applying to colleges. UCSD, for instance, also operates on a lottery system for admission.
3. Showcase your coding and programming involvement through extracurricular activities. Teaching roles, as exemplified by Anthony's stint at CodeNinjas, signal a deeper understanding.
4. Set yourself apart with personal coding projects. Tristan's extensive project portfolio not only helped him secure an internship but also paved the way for a full-time position at LG.
5. Cold outreach to potential employers through calls and emails can open doors to internship opportunities.
6. Explore resources like the SDSC Center for Machine Learning to enhance your knowledge.
7. Highlight your proficiency with specific tools, including deployment tools like Vercel and SvelteKit (similar to React), to attract employers.
8. Develop a professional online presence through a personal website. This platform effectively communicates your experiences, projects, and areas of expertise to both employers and peers.

# Reflection
From attending this panel, I learned that, in computer science, success is contingent on a combination of foundational academic preparation, practical skills development through personal projects and coding involvement, proactive engagement with potential employers, and the adept use of tools and online presence to communicate one's expertise. The insights shared by Collin, Tristan, Mabel, and Anthony provided a practical roadmap for pursuing a career in computer science. The emphasis on taking CSP and CSA to prepare for a major in this field is clear. It's apparent that competition is fierce, even for entry into UCSD. Extracurricular involvement in coding, preferably with teaching experience like Anthony's at CodeNinjas, is a notable advantage. Projects are essential for standing out, as Tristan's experience with LG demonstrates. Cold outreach to employers is a viable strategy. Familiarity with tools and deployment platforms like Vercel and SvelteKit is highly valued. Lastly, a personal website is a must to showcase expertise and projects. I've already started on a few of these--like participating in CS-related internships, or having a personal website--and I'm excited to continue with my journey into the world of computer science.
